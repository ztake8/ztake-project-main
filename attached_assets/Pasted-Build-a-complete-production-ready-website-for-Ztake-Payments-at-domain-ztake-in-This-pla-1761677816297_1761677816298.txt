Build a complete, production-ready website for **Ztake Payments** at domain **ztake.in**.  
This platform is a modern payment and fintech ecosystem inspired by **Razorpay + Stripe**, designed for Indian and international businesses.  

The website must be **Apple-inspired**, visually resembling the **iPhone liquid glass aesthetic** — minimal, fluid, premium, and immersive.

---

### 🎨 DESIGN LANGUAGE — Apple iPhone Liquid Glass Theme

- Use a **liquid glass UI** throughout the site: soft frosted-glass cards with backdrop blur, gentle white glow edges, and subtle reflection highlights.  
- Add **depth using transparency + layering**. Cards and sections should look like floating translucent glass panes over softly blurred gradients.  
- **Animations**: micro springy interactions, parallax hero scroll, smooth opacity transitions, and gentle scale effects. Use **Framer Motion** or CSS transitions.  
- **Typography**: Apple-style sans-serif — use system font stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial`).  
- **Colors**:  
  - Light mode — white, silvers, light greys with blue/indigo accents (#3B82F6 or #2563EB).  
  - Dark mode — deep charcoal/black glass with glowing white text and neon indigo highlights.  
- **Layout**: rounded corners (2xl radius), large padding, floating nav bar with blur, and pill-shaped CTAs.  
- **Responsive**: mobile-first (optimized for iPhone 13–15), adaptive layouts for tablet and desktop.  
- **Bottom nav on mobile** like iOS apps (Dashboard, Payments, Invoices, Support).  
- **Accessibility**: 4.5:1 contrast ratio, reduced motion option, and proper ARIA labels.

### ⚙️ TECHNICAL SPECS

- **Frontend**: Next.js + React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion animations.  
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express/Nest) or Python (FastAPI).  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL.  
- **Caching & Queues**: Redis.  
- **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend, AWS or GCP for backend APIs.  
- **Docs**: auto-generated from OpenAPI spec with interactive API playground.  
- **SEO**: SSR pages, sitemap.xml, structured data.  
- **Analytics**: GA4 + server-side events.
